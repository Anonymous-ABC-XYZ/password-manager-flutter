# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity & UI Principles
- **Material Design 3 (M3):** Adhere to M3 component specifications and structural guidelines but deviate from strict seed-based generation.
- **Vibrant & Custom Palette:** Employ a hand-picked, multi-hued color scheme that prioritizes vibrancy and distinctiveness over monochromatic or seed-generated uniformity. Ensure colors are bold and energetic while maintaining accessible contrast.
- **Dynamic Theming:** Provide comprehensive support for both Light and Dark modes. The interface must adapt seamlessly to system brightness changes, ensuring optimal readability and aesthetic appeal in all environments.

## Interactive Design & UX
- **Tactile Responsiveness:** Implement state-aware styling for all interactive elements using `WidgetStateProperty`. Incorporate subtle, high-quality animations to provide immediate visual feedback and a premium, high-end desktop feel.
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Establish a strong hierarchy through the strategic use of elevation (shadows), color contrast, and typographic scale. Primary actions (e.g., "Add Credential") should be visually distinct from secondary or destructive operations.

## Prose & Communication
- **Trust-Oriented Tone:** Maintain a professional, direct, and authoritative voice across all app text. Avoid jargon where possible, but use precise terminology to reinforce the application's security and reliability.
- **Proactive Guidance:** Integrate helpful explanations and contextual tooltips, especially for complex configuration steps (like Google OAuth setup). Messages should be informative without being intrusive, guiding the user toward success.
